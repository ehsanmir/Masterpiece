This is a game created with Unreal Engine 4 to challenge your spatial intelligence.

> **Spatial intelligence** is a human computational capacity that provides the ability or mental skill to solve spatial problems of navigation, visualization of objects from different angles and space, faces or scenes recognition, or to notice fine details. It could be more effective to solve problems in areas related to realistic, thing-oriented, and investigative occupations.
